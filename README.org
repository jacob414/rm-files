* rm-files

An experiment with the line files for the remarkable tablet. The
stretch goal is to be able to convert a .SVG file to a .rm
file. Preferably also with the ability to insert it into the tablets
file system.

** Claude 3 Opus experiment

This is going to be a dual purpose project, I'm going to see how far I
can get with AI code generation and assisted development, and add the
corresponding docs (hopefully). If you see some unsavoury code,
remember, it's probably Claude, not me! ;-)
