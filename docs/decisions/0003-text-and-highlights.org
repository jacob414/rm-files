* Text and Highlights â€” Modeling Strategy
:PROPERTIES:
:Status: Accepted (phase 1)
:END:

** Context
- =rmfiles/deps/scene_items.py= includes =Text= and =GlyphRange= types.
- We want =RemarkableNotebook.text()= and =RemarkableNotebook.highlight()= in the public API.

** Decision (phase 1)
- Provide API method =RemarkableNotebook.text(...)= to enqueue text as root text blocks (=RootTextBlock=) with position and width.
- Defer highlight (=GlyphRange=) implementation initially; API shape is =highlight(text, rectangles, color=...)=. Implementation now compiles highlights into layers using =SceneGlyphItemBlock=.
- Keep the compiler pure; continue to reuse our existing block assembly for layers and lines and then append root text blocks.

** Consequences
- Unblocks the API shape now while allowing incremental implementation without breaking changes.
