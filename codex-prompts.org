Good. Add, commit and push. After trying make qa I notice that the
vulture tests isn't relevant at this stage in the project. Make them
optional and don't run them unless I tell you too. When that's done,
add, commit and push.

Add a GitHub Actions workflow mirroring make ci.

There was a failure in the CI run, I've downloaded logs and put them
in './logs_45111281811/'. Investigate and fix. If it's not a config
issue, create a test and iterate TDD-style on it untill it's
fixed. When done, add commit and push.

The CI run failed again with this message:

  RequiredDependencyException: pangocairo >= 1.30.0 is required

Fix.
